            No matter where you are working from, once out of focus, it takes
            you an average of 25 minutes to fully focus again!

          <p>
            Distractions are everywhere and most of the time you have very
            little control over them: a sound notification from your phone or
            computer, someone on a call next to you, people coming in and out,
            or a simple thought youâ€™re having in your mind giving you no rest.

          <h3>Personalize everything.</h3>
          <p>

            second do you need it to change? Do you want all colors or do you
            want a specific color? How many session do you plan to do each day?
            How much long should each session last? Nemo is highly customizable.
