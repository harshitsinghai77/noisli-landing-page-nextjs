            Distractions are everywhere and most of the time you have very
            little control over them: a sound notification from your phone or
            computer, someone on a call next to you, people coming in and out,
            or a simple thought youâ€™re having in your mind giving you no rest.

            With our Timer, students can stay concentrated in small blocks of
            time in order to be more efficient without draining too much energy.
            Moreover, frequent breaks allow students to recharge and enter the
            next session fresh and energized. The length of the Timer and the
            Breaks can be customized individually by each user.
